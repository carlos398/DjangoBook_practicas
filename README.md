# HELLO I'M CARLOS

First of all you have to create a virtual env 
    - "you can do it with the command 'virtualenv venv'"
    - "or maybe with py -m venv venv venv"

secondly u can install all the requirements using the file "requirements.txt".

### that's all for today, I will make more updates on this project every day -bye bye
